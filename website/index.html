            <h3>Senior Site Reliability Engineer &amp; Cloud Engineer</h3>
            <p class="fst-italic"> It is not the strongest of the species that survive, nor the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change.</p>
            </p> My name is Michael Connaker, and I am an experienced Site Reliability Engineer and Cloud Engineer. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>
              With over a decade of experience in Information Technology, I have worked across a broad spectrum of disciplines, including networking, systems administration, desktop support, 
              and cloud management. Currently I specialize as a Site Reliability Engineer and Cloud Engineer, where my expertise in Infrastructure as Code (IaC), GitOps, Configuration Managment
              and CI/CD tools is used to automate deployments for improved efficiency, scalability, and cost optimization. I have a strong ability to drive collaboration with clients and teams, 
              ensuring seamless execution and delivery of results. </p>
            
            <p>
              I have extensive leadership experience, serving as a Subject Matter Expert (SME) to clients and colleagues, as well as a Team Lead managing a team of 8 to 12 members. In this role, 
              I provided guidance and direction, collaborated with management to develop and enhance onboarding procedures, SLAs, SLOs, technical documentation, and shaped the team’s vision and strategy. 
              Additionally, as an Agile leader, I facilitated sprints, reported progress to senior leadership, and led Scrum of Scrums and retrospectives to drive continuous improvement.
            </p>

            <p>
              I am educated with a Bachelors of Arts in General Studies and Associates of Applied Science in Computer Networking & Systems Administration. I have also achieved
              several industry certifications.
            </p>

            <p>
              Outside the technical realm, I’m an avid reader with a passion for Sci-Fi and Supernatural genres, and a dedicated gamer, having explored countless 
              virtual worlds across multiple platforms. Yet, my most fulfilling adventure is fatherhood to my two teenage daughters and a newborn son — a role that brings immense 
              joy and fresh challenges every day.</p>
